<guid>https://varient.codingest.net/nasa-industry-improve-lidars-for-exploration-science</guid>
<description><![CDATA[ NASA engineers will test a suite of new laser technologies from an aircraft this summer for Earth science remote sensing. Called lidar, the instruments could also be used to improve models of the Moon’s shape and aid the search for Artemis landing sites. Similar to sonar, but using light instead of sound, lidars calculate distances […] ]]></description>
